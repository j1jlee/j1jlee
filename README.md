### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jaewon Lee, and I'm a former IT Consultant looking to make a switch into full-stack engineering!

I've just completed a six-month intensive programming boot-camp in App Academy, where we went through a gauntlet of learning the following technologies:
- Javascript
- Python
- Express.js / Flask (backend)
- SQL / SQLAlchemy / PostGres
- React.js (frontend)
- HTML, CSS, Git, etc...

Looking forward to creating applications that can boost productivity, or introduce gamified elements into regular apps!
